      <h1>💻 Why I Started Programming</h1>
      <p class="meta">Not to master every syntax — but to understand how code works and build ideas with AI.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
      <p>When I first looked at code, I didn’t think I could ever write it. It looked complex, filled with symbols and logic that didn’t make sense at first glance. But curiosity pulled me in. I wanted to understand how things worked — not to become a professional programmer, but to see how technology actually breathes from the inside.</p>

      <p>So I began small. I started watching <strong>YouTube lectures</strong> instead of taking official paid courses. I found Harvard’s <strong>CS50</strong> lectures on YouTube — the same ones taught by <em>David J. Malan</em> — and they became my foundation. I didn’t take the course from the official site, but I studied every topic from those lectures at my own pace.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “I didn’t learn programming to memorize syntax — I learned it to understand what happens when I run a line of code.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Learning from YouTube and mentors</h2>
      <p>Along with CS50, I learned a lot from <strong>CodeWithHarry</strong> — his tutorials made concepts simple and practical. From him, I learned Python and C in depth, and understood how programming logic actually flows. I also used <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> to strengthen my basics and practice writing clean code.</p>

      <p>Most of my learning happened through videos, trial, and error. I’d watch a concept, try it myself, make mistakes, and ask <strong>AI tools</strong> like ChatGPT for help when stuck. That combination — YouTube + AI + self-practice — became my personal classroom.</p>

      <h2>Programming with AI</h2>
      <p>Over time, I realized I didn’t need to know every language deeply — I just needed to understand the logic behind it. Now, I mostly use <strong>AI tools</strong> to help me build and debug my projects. I read the code, try to understand what it’s doing, and improve it through feedback and learning. I don’t code everything from scratch, but I make sure I understand what’s happening behind every project I create.</p>

      <h2>How programming connects with my journey</h2>
      <p>Programming gave me the confidence to build ideas like <strong>My Mitra</strong> and <strong>IntervAI</strong>. It helped me bridge the gap between imagination and creation — even when coding felt difficult. Every project I built taught me more about logic, structure, and the power of combining AI with programming.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “For me, programming isn’t about typing — it’s about understanding, creating, and connecting ideas with reality.”
      </blockquote>

      <footer>
        <p>I still learn programming every day — not from textbooks, but from doing, watching, and experimenting. My goal isn’t to be a perfect coder, but to be a creator who understands how things work and can use AI to build something meaningful.</p>
