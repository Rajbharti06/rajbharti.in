      <h1>🤖 Why I Started Learning Robotics</h1>
      <p class="meta">To bring my ideas to life — to create something I can touch, secure, and make think for itself.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
      <p>For me, robotics wasn’t a new beginning — it was a continuation of everything I had learned before.  
      I had already explored <strong>cybersecurity</strong> — understanding how systems stay safe. I had learned <strong>programming</strong> — how logic turns into movement. And I had discovered <strong>AI</strong> — how machines start thinking like humans.  
      But I wanted more than screens and terminals. I wanted something I could <em>feel</em>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Robotics felt like the moment where all my knowledge could finally move, see, and react. It was my way of giving life to code.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>When I built software, I could see it work — but I couldn’t touch it. With robotics, everything changed. It’s the space where <strong>AI meets reality</strong>, where logic turns into motion, and where security becomes physical.  
      I wanted to make systems that don’t just think — they act. And not just act, but act safely, efficiently, and with purpose.</p>

      <h2>Where it began</h2>
      <p>My first step into robotics came naturally. While working on AI projects like <strong>My Mitra</strong> and <strong>IntervAI</strong>, I started thinking about how those systems could exist in real life — as devices that could sense, respond, and move.  
      Around that time, I began exploring <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, microcontrollers, and sensors — learning how software can talk to hardware.</p>

      <p>I started small — LEDs, motors, motion sensors, and speech modules. But even those simple circuits made me feel something different: the joy of creation. I wasn’t just writing code anymore; I was <strong>building something that could move, listen, and respond</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Learning the way I always have</h2>
      <p>Like everything else, I didn’t learn robotics from a classroom. I learned from <strong>YouTube videos, online tutorials, documentation, and AI tools</strong> that explained what I didn’t understand. I watched creators and engineers turn wires into ideas and followed step-by-step — testing, failing, and fixing until it worked.</p>

      <p>Whenever I got stuck, I used <strong>AI assistants</strong> like ChatGPT and Perplexity to understand circuits, Python GPIO, and automation logic. I mixed my cybersecurity awareness with AI knowledge — making sure my devices were <strong>secure, private, and ethical</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Why robotics matters to me</h2>
      <p>For me, robotics isn’t just about building robots — it’s about <strong>combining everything I’ve learned</strong> into something alive. Cybersecurity taught me to make systems safe. Programming taught me to structure ideas. AI taught me to make them intelligent.  
      Robotics lets me <strong>connect all of that</strong> — to create machines that can help, protect, and understand.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “I started robotics because I wanted to see my knowledge move — to make something I can touch, feel, and trust.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>My dream is to create intelligent systems that act responsibly — machines that understand people, protect privacy, and make life easier. Whether it’s an assistant that helps students or a device that makes learning emotional and interactive, I want to build it — not just code it.</p>

        <p>Robotics for me is not the end — it’s where all my journeys come together. It’s where code gets a body, where AI gets a purpose, and where curiosity becomes something I can hold in my hands.</p>
