      <h1>Why I Started Cybersecurity</h1>
      <p class="meta">From a small town to terminal windows — how curiosity, mobile-game tinkering and YouTube lessons became my path into cybersecurity.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>I didn’t start cybersecurity because I wanted to “hack” or chase a trend. I started because I wanted to <strong>understand</strong> how things work — and why they sometimes break.</p>

      <p>Growing up in a small town, tools and resources were limited. If something went wrong, I didn’t wait for someone else to fix it — I tried to fix it myself. That curiosity followed me into the digital world. As a kid I used to <strong>tinker with mobile games</strong>: poking save files, testing mods, and trying to bend game behavior just to see what happened. It wasn’t about theft or mischief — it was about exploring rules that were hidden under the surface.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “When things broke, I didn’t wait — I tried to know why. That habit became the reason I chose cybersecurity.”  
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What I learned first</h2>
      <p>My early steps were simple but important: I learned basic <strong>Linux</strong> and started writing small <strong>Bash scripts</strong> to automate tasks. Then I tried hands-on challenges — Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions — and felt the real thrill of solving problems that weren’t obvious. Finding that first flag changed how I thought: it was frustrating, then deeply satisfying.</p>

      <h2>Courses, paths and people who helped</h2>
      <p class="muted">Most of what I learned came from YouTube videos and free hands-on platforms — creators who explain things in a practical way and platforms that let you try things in a browser.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="resource"><strong>Why these?</strong> The Cisco Networking Academy course gave me big-picture context about threats and protection. TryHackMe provided guided, hands-on rooms I could complete in-browser. OverTheWire Bandit taught me command-line basics in a game-like sequence. NetworkChuck and David Bombal were my go-to YouTube teachers for networking and CCNA-level practice. CS50’s Intro to Cybersecurity added a structured academic perspective. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

      <h2>CTFs and practice</h2>
      <p>CTFs were where everything came together. TryHackMe rooms plus OverTheWire levels gave me practical experience: SSH, file permissions, basic forensics, binary basics, web exploitation patterns, and scripting to automate routine tasks. I wrote small reports and notes for each challenge I solved — this helped me remember methods and thought processes.</p>

      <h2>Mostly learned from YouTube</h2>
      <p>Honestly — most of my progress came from YouTube. I followed tutorials, playlists, and lab walkthroughs. Watching someone perform a technique and then trying it myself in a lab environment helped me learn quickly without expensive courses. NetworkChuck and David Bombal’s playlists were especially helpful for networking and CCNA-level concepts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

      <h2>What it means now</h2>
      <p>Today, cybersecurity is how I choose to think about systems: not only how they’re built, but how they can fail and how to protect them. It’s the same curiosity that made me tinker with games as a child — but now I keep it ethical and practical. I solve puzzles, learn new tools, and try to leave systems a little safer than I found them.</p>
