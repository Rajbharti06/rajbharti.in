      <h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
      <p>In November 2025, Princeton University fell victim to a sophisticated vishing (voice phishing) attack that briefly compromised its Advancement database. While no financial or social security data was exposed, the breach exposed systemic vulnerabilities in higher education cybersecurity.</p>

      <p>This independently researched case study investigates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The full breach timeline</li>
        <li>STRIDE threat model and MITRE ATT&CK mapping</li>
        <li>Institutional response and risk implications</li>
        <li>Sector-wide comparison with other major universities</li>
        <li>Strategic recommendations for incident detection, MFA, and user training</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📘 What You'll Learn</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How social engineering threats bypass even mature IT infrastructures</li>
        <li>What Princeton did right — and what it could have done better</li>
        <li>Key lessons for universities, IT admins, and cybersecurity students</li>
        <li>A multi-layered defense framework tailored to higher ed institutions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🛡️ Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>With the rise in data breaches targeting student records, donor databases, and research archives, higher education institutions need modernized threat detection, user behavior analytics (UEBA), and phishing-resistant MFA. This paper blends public incident data, visual models, and sector-wide comparisons to drive better security strategies.</p>

      <h2>🙏 Why I’m Sharing This Freely</h2>
      <p>I chose not to publish this case study through a paid journal or conference because the costs were simply too high for me at this time. But I didn’t want that to stop the work from reaching others.</p>
      <p>This research comes from a place of genuine passion. I’ve spent years educating my family and community on how to stay safe online—especially from social engineering and phishing attacks. When this Princeton breach occurred, it struck a personal chord. At the time, I was preparing for Ivy League admissions, and this incident felt close, urgent, and relevant. So I dove deep into it, using everything I’ve learned so far.</p>
      <p>This work represents not just academic effort—but lived experience, personal motivation, and the belief that cybersecurity awareness must be accessible.</p>
      <p>If this helps you, inspires you, or sparks a conversation—that’s the real reward.</p>
