      <h1>🤖 Why I Started Learning AI</h1>
      <p class="meta">From cybersecurity to building human-like AI projects — my journey with ChatGPT, Perplexity, and code.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>When I started learning <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, I never imagined that path would lead me to <strong>AI</strong>. At first, I used tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Perplexity</strong> just to help me understand concepts and commands faster — to debug Bash scripts, explain network terms, or generate summaries from research papers. But soon, I realized AI wasn’t just a tool. It was a world of its own.</p>

      <p>While exploring cybersecurity labs and CTFs, I started wondering how these AI models actually worked behind the scenes — how they could understand context, reason, and respond like humans. That curiosity made me start learning <strong>AI and coding side by side</strong>.</p>

      <p>Coding wasn’t easy for me. Honestly, it felt tough. But instead of giving up, I learned to integrate my <strong>AI knowledge</strong> with code. I used AI tools to generate ideas, structure my code, and debug errors. Slowly, I began building real things — starting small, then growing into projects that mattered.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “AI became my silent teacher — available 24/7, never tired, always explaining, and always pushing me one step ahead.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>From learning to building</h2>
      <p>With every line of code I understood, I built something new. Some of my favorite projects came out of this journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>My Mitra</strong> — an emotional AI mentor app built for students, completely offline, focused on privacy and connection.</li>
        <li><strong>IntervAI</strong> — an AI interview preparation platform with real-time feedback, voice input, and performance tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Apoclyps GPT</strong> — an experimental hackathon project using LLMs to simulate crisis-solving intelligence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These projects taught me how AI could connect deeply with humans — not just automate tasks, but <strong>understand emotions, guide people, and make learning personal</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Learning by watching and doing</h2>
      <p>I learned mostly by watching YouTube videos, trying, failing, and asking AI for help. I followed creators like <strong>Andrej Karpathy</strong>, who explained how LLMs think and how neural networks really work. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> opened my eyes to what’s possible when math meets creativity.</p>

      <p>I practiced prompt writing, explored open-source models, and started understanding the structure of <strong>transformers</strong> — how they learn, process tokens, and predict words. I also explored how <strong>local LLMs</strong> can run offline and be integrated into personal assistants.</p>

      <h2>Certifications and learning paths</h2>
      <p>To build credibility and structure my learning, I completed or plan to complete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</strong> — Harvard / edX.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AI Essentials</strong> — Coursera.</li>
        <li><strong>Elements of AI</strong> — University of Helsinki.</li>
        <li><strong>AI for Everyone</strong> — Andrew Ng (Coursera).</li>
        <li><strong>IBM Generative AI Fundamentals</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tools and platforms I used</h2>

      <h2>What AI means to me now</h2>
      <p>AI isn’t just code to me anymore — it’s a way to express ideas. It helped me build when I didn’t know how, speak when I didn’t have confidence, and create things that matter. It taught me persistence, logical thinking, and creativity all at once. I see AI not as a replacement for humans, but as an extension of our imagination.</p>

        “I didn’t just learn AI to use it — I learned AI to understand it, and to build something human with it.”
      </blockquote>

        <p>If you want, I’ll soon write a detailed post about how I built <strong>My Mitra</strong> — from idea to architecture, using local models and emotional AI design.</p>
