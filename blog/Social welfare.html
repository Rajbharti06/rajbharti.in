        <h2>🧠 Story</h2>
        <p>When I was in Class 11 at Kendriya Vidyalaya Ghazipur, I was chosen to lead a team for the 31st National Children’s Science Congress (NCSC) 2023, under the theme “Understanding Ecosystem for Health and Well-being.” Our project focused on “Education and Awareness” — exploring how knowledge, lifestyle, and culture shape the connection between humans and the environment.</p>
        <p>As the group leader, I took charge of almost everything — from researching and surveying local communities to analyzing data and preparing our final presentation. For nearly two months, I worked passionately on it, walking through different areas of my town to talk to people about pollution, cleanliness, and sustainability. I wanted to understand how aware people really were about the ecosystem they lived in. Most of them weren’t — and that realization pushed me even harder.</p>
        <p>I spent countless nights refining the project, preparing visuals, and practicing the explanation for the regional presentation at Varanasi. It was more than just a science project for me; it became a message — that education and awareness are the roots of a sustainable world.</p>
        <p>But just when everything was ready, I faced something I hadn’t expected. My teacher told me I was one month older than the eligibility limit for NCSC participation. That single month meant I couldn’t represent my own project at the regional level.</p>
        <p>I still remember that moment — standing there, having to hand over the project I built from the ground up to my teammate. It wasn’t easy, but I decided to stay and help. I guided my team through the final preparations, ensured they were confident, and stood by them all the way.</p>
        <p>In the end, our project won a prize at the regional level. Even though I couldn’t be the one presenting, it still felt like our shared victory. That moment taught me something far more valuable than any medal — that true leadership isn’t about being in the spotlight, it’s about building something strong enough to succeed even when you step back.</p>
        <p>This project didn’t just make me a better student — it made me a better person. It strengthened my belief that small acts of awareness and education can drive real change.</p>
